# Multi-Agent Resource Gathering System

This project simulates a multi-agent system where multiple agents collaborate in a 2D grid environment to gather resources and return them to a shared depot. The system demonstrates task allocation, agent coordination, and performance tracking.

## Features
- **Grid Environment**: A 2D grid with randomly placed resources and a central depot.
- **Autonomous Agents**: Agents navigate to collect resources and deposit them.
- **Task Allocation**: A central coordinator assigns the nearest resource to each agent.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks total resources collected and visualises results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy and Matplotlib (install via `pip install numpy matplotlib`)

## How to Run
1. Open `MultiAgentResourceGathering.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells sequentially to get the final result.

## Customisation
- Modify grid size, number of agents/resources, and simulation steps in the notebook.
